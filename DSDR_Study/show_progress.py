Script behind the PowerFactory script object "Final(1)".  The report appears in the Output Window.

First (always)     load flow on all buses and branches, "From node -> To node", DG disconnected
                   and connected                                          loadflow_all_buses.py

Stage 1 (RUN_DATABASE)  load-flow and short-circuit database, DG disconnected and connected, with the
                   current through R1 and R2 and its direction, If,max, If,min and a validation
                   checklist                                                  database_study.py
                   -> results/database/  (no relay or fuse setting is touched)

Stage 2 (only when RUN_COORDINATION = True, i.e. after the database has been checked)
                   design by the paper's method: Tables II, III, IV, Figs. 14, 17;
                   settings written into the model and PowerFactory's trip times checked;
                   Tables I-IV (Table IV with the fuse t_MMT) -> results/database/   make_tables.py
                                                    step2_studies.py, step3_..., step4_...

While it runs, PowerFactory fills the Output Window with its own messages (a fault on a phase a
bus does not have is reported as "Short-circuit calculation not possible"; that is normal).  At the
end the window is cleared and only the report is printed.  The report is also saved as
results/Show_Progress_output.txt.

Replaces the old Show_Progress.py, which needs relays named "R1" and "R2"; in this model they are
"R1 Fast", "R1 Delayed", "R2 Fast", "R2 Delayed", "R2 Rev Fast", "R2 Rev Delayed".

Run: Python Script (ComPython) -> Execute.  The model is left in the study case
"Study with Substation Transformer".
